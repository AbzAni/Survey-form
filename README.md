# Survey-form
I tried creating survey form using only html and css, I still have a lot things to learn, I still haven't learned things like flexbox, grid and etc. that is related to css, so yeah this is it for now, took me 2-3 hours to make, even though I know it looks horrible, but I'm still happy with the results though, credits to @freecodecamp.
